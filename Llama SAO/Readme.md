# Llama SAO
This was a last minute SAO that was just for fun. It's just 2 LEDs and a resistor. The board was produced with white soldermask and black silkscreen. Note that some boardhouses remove silkscreen that overlaps bare copper. You'll have to make sure they don't do that for the board to come out right.
